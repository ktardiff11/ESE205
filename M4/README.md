# ESE205 Module 4

This module concerns interfacing with the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensors, as well as moving average calculation, and python import syntax.

## A Note about Pin Numbers

For the code in this repository to work, we expect you to use Pin 16 as the Ultrasonic Trigger Pin, and Pin 15 as the Ultrasonic Echo Pin. Feel free to change the pins you use, but you will have to modify the code in this repository.
