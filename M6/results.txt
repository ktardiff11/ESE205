Ranges:
DCmin = 3 Theta min = 0
DCmax = 14  Theta Max = 180 
DC @7 = 90 degrees

angle = arctan( y - height/2, x - width / 2)
Where x and y are the coordinates of the center mass of the target object.
If we were to have an image with the size 200x200 and coordinates at 120, 130

angle = arctan(130 - 100, 120 - 100) = 56

For the best values we used:
Delay: .25
Delta: .5 
Nah, increasing did not effect the rate in which the images aer taken to affect the values used for delta.
