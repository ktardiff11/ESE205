4d.
Lowest Duty Cycle: 14.5

5.e calc_rpm
By Hand:
139 transitions/5.11 s * 1 rev/4 transitions * 60 s / 1 min = 408.023 rev/min

From Program:
408 RPM. 

We did 5.11 s to get exactly 512 data points due to our delay of .01 seconds. 
We did this in order to not modify our raw data for the FFT program. 


est_rpm
For the estimated RPM from the FFT plot we obtained a RPM of 405, for a duty cycle of 50%. 
When comparing it to calc_rpm we had a pretty good estimation of the RPM. 
Having a percentage difference of .745%

(|405-408|/408)*100 =.735%
